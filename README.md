Before running the code, make sure all the missing files have been added to the specified location.
To run the code, please make sure you are in the main directory.

Code files
================================================
In this section, we define some important source code files that are included in this submission with a description of the files 

src\components\PositiveNews.js: The PositiveNews component builds the page to share positive headlines from 8 top news outlets.

src\components\PredictNews.js: The PredictNews component builds the page to do sentiment analysis on real-time headlines.

src\index.js: index component imports the App.js component and tells React where to render it. 

Missing supplementary files
================================================
In this section, we define and describe the additional files that are not provided with the submission due to size constraints.

node_modules folder: the folder contains libraries downloaded from npm, mainly contains the React Ant design library which is used in the frontend. This folder should be put in the main directory before running the code, it is not provided due to size constraints.

To get this folder, one can download it from: https://github.com/czhen08/HappyNewsFrontend

Another opinion is to mannually install the missing React Ant design library, the command is:
### `npm install antd`
